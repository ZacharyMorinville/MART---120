        <p>	As he stands, he looks very similar to how he does presently, just with less graying hair and wrinkles. He is wearing the typical Watch uniform, sliding the mask on and putting up his hood, but it now has a considerable amount of blood splattered on. The main eye-catcher, however, is the very blank, very dead expression seen on his face. There could be a million thoughts going through his head, or none. Maybe this outcome was fate, maybe it is the result of many mistakes piling on top of each other, either way, all hope is gone from this person. Death isnt justice, life isnt justice. Justice has never existed and never will. There is nothing left intact of this persons former being. Everything will change now, and the path his family brought him up to follow will no longer be left without footsteps covering it. The sick consequence of his existence has finally caught up to him, and now he will restart from the beginning. Whether this is a good or bad thing, he will have to wait and see.
